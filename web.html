        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As companies processes become automated, more of their infrastructure is rooted in technology. Every automated system is created by code that can be accessed when cybercriminals break in. Thus, the more processes that are done digitally, the more opportunities hackers get to steal private information. This is bad news for businesses, but good news for Cybersecurity Management graduates who find an increasing demand for their skills.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Blockchain-Future Technology</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Although most people think of blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchain offers security that is useful in many other ways. In the simplest of terms, blockchain can be described as data you can only add to, not take away from or change. Hence the term “chain” because you’re making a chain of data. Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. In addition, blockchains are consensus-driven, so no one entity can take control of the data. With blockchain, you don’t need a trusted third-party to oversee or validate transactions.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Internet of Things(IoT)</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many “things” are now being built with WiFi connectivity, meaning they can be connected to the Internet—and to each other. Hence, the Internet of Things, or IoT. The Internet of Things is the future and has already enabled devices, home appliances, cars, and much more to be connected to and exchange data over the Internet. And we’re only in the beginning stages of IoT: the number of IoT devices reached 8.4 billion in 2017 is expected to reach 30 billion devices by 2020.</p>
